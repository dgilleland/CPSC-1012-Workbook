# Learning Outcome Guides ![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation%20Status-40--70%25%20Incomplete/Draft-orange?logo=Read%20the%20Docs)

> ***NOTE:** It's been a few years since I (Dan) have taught this course, so this LOG file may be "out-of-date".*
> 
> *For best results, take the [LOGs](https://programming-0101.github.io/TheBook/About/log-summary.html) from my personal **Programming Fundamentals** site and blend them with the ones in this document.

You are encouraged to add summary notes for each learning outcome.
